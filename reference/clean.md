# Clean orphaned records in vegtable object

Delete entries in slots `header` and `species` orphaned by manipulation
of slots.

Orphaned records generated by modifications in some slots may cause a
loss on the validity of
[vegtable](http://kamapu.github.io/vegtable/reference/vegtable-class.md)
objects. This function should be applied to optimise the allocated size
of a
[vegtable](http://kamapu.github.io/vegtable/reference/vegtable-class.md)
object, as well. Since running cleaning only once does not assure the
deletion of all orphaned entries, it is recommended to run it at least
twice. This repetition of cleaning is controlled by the argument
`times`.

## Usage

``` r
clean_once(object)

# S4 method for class 'vegtable'
clean(object, times = 2, ...)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  A
  [vegtable](http://kamapu.github.io/vegtable/reference/vegtable-class.md)
  object.

- times:

  Numeric value indicating how many times should be the cleaning be
  repeated.

- ...:

  Further arguments passed from or to other methods.

## Value

A clean
[vegtable](http://kamapu.github.io/vegtable/reference/vegtable-class.md)
object.
